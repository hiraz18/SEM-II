This C program implements all major operations on a doubly linked list using functions. A doubly linked list is a collection of nodes where each node has three parts — an integer data field to store the value, and two pointers: prev (pointing to the previous node) and next (pointing to the next node). The list starts with head, which points to the first node. The program allows the user to create a list by entering how many nodes to add and the data for each. During creation, nodes are linked both forward (next) and backward (prev). The program includes different insertion functions: inserting at the beginning (by making the new node’s next point to the old head and updating head), at the end (by traversing till the last node and adding the new one), or at a specific position (by carefully adjusting the links of surrounding nodes). Similarly, deletion functions remove nodes from the beginning, end, or a given position by reassigning pointers and freeing memory. The traversal() function displays the list both forwards (from head to end) and backwards (from last node to head) using the doubly linked nature. The main() function is menu-driven—it repeatedly displays options to perform any of these operations until the user chooses to exit. Overall, this program demonstrates how a doubly linked list works through node creation, bidirectional linking, insertion, deletion, and traversal using dynamic memory management in C.
